# Audio Cataloger - QA Testing Project

## 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains comprehensive testing documentation for the **Audio Cataloger** project - a console application designed to catalog audio files, find duplicates, and detect corrupted files. The testing was performed as part of the Software Testing training program under **IT Connect UA** project (Kharkiv IT Cluster in cooperation with EPAM Ukraine).

## 🎯 Application Description

**Audio Cataloger** is a Java-based console application that:
- Catalogs audio files in specified directories
- Identifies duplicate audio files using smart comparison algorithms
- Detects corrupted audio files
- Generates output in both HTML and CSV formats
- Supports multiple audio formats: MP3, FLAC, WAV, OGG, WMA

### Key Features
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux)
- Multi-directory scanning with duplicate prevention
- Robust error handling and exception management
- Configurable output modes (all files or duplicates only)

## 📁 Repository Contents

This repository includes the following QA deliverables:

- **Test Plan** - Comprehensive testing strategy and approach
- **Test Cases** - Detailed test scenarios covering functional requirements
- **Checklists** - Quick verification lists for testing activities  
- **Defect Reports** - Documentation of identified bugs and issues
- **Test Results Report** - Summary of testing execution and outcomes

## 🔧 Testing Scope

The testing covered the following areas:

### Functional Testing
- Command line parameter validation
- Audio file processing (MP3, FLAC, WAV, OGG, WMA)
- Duplicate detection algorithms
- Output generation (HTML/CSV formats)
- Error handling and messaging

### Non-Functional Testing
- File size limitations (up to 2GB)
- Performance with large file sets
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Application reliability and crash prevention

### Test Types Performed
- Positive testing scenarios
- Negative testing with invalid inputs
- Boundary value testing
- Error handling verification
- Requirements traceability testing
